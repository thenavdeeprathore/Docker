Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files.

All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines.

Containers make creation, deployment, and running of application a lot easier. It binds application and its dependencies inside a container.


The docker containers are suited for situations where you want to run multiple applications over a single operating system kernel. 
But if you have applications or servers that need to run on different operating system flavors, then virtual machines are best approach.
