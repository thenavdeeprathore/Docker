What is Clair?

Clair is a popular open source vulnerability scanning solution for docker images made by CoreOS. 
Clair is also integrated with quay.io public docker registry and Quay Enterprise, both products of CoreOS.

As a source of vulnerabilities, it uses CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) data sources like NIST NVD as well as 
security bug trackers of the specific Linux distributions supported by Clair.

Clair doesnâ€™t have a web UI or even a command-line tool; so the only way to work with it is via its REST API or a third-party CLI tool.



Architecture and Clair components
Clair is composed of 2 components:

Clair
        REST API server
        CVE Updater which takes care of updating database of vulnerabilities
        List of CVE data sources
PostgreSQL 9.4+
        Storage of vulnerabilities database and results of analysis of uploaded docker image layers






This is where clair-scanner comes into place. The clair-scanner does the following:

-   Scans an image against Clair server
-   Compares the vulnerabilities against a whitelist
-   Tells you if there are vulnerabilities that are not in the whitelist and fails
-   If everything is fine it completes correctly
