# Host Network
# This driver removes the network isolation between the docker host and the docker containers to use the host's networking directly.

docker container run -dt --name myhost --network host ubuntu
docker container run -dt --name mybridge ubuntu
docker container exec -it myhost bash
apt-get update && apt-get install net-tools
netstat -ntlp
# You can see all the ports including host and container ports
ifconfig
# You can see all the interfaces associated with the host
apt-get install nginx -y
/etc/init.d/nginx start
netstat -ntlp
# nginx is listening on the port 80 which is of the host
