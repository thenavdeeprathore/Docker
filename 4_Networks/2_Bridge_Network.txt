# Bridge Network

# Bridge is the default network driver for Docker
# When you start Docker, a default network (also known as bridge) is created automatically, and newly started containers connect to it.
# A bridge network uses a software bridge which allows containers connected to the same bridge network to communicate, while providing isolation
# from containers which are not connected to that bridge network.
